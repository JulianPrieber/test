## Function    
**LittleLink Custom provides** you with **a website similar to** [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/). Many **social media platforms only allow you to add one link**, with this you can simply **link to your LittleLink Custom page** and have **all the links you want** displayed on one site. You can share all your links to your social media platform or important links to **easy accessible and hosted on your own web-server** or web-hosting provider. On this website, other users can register and create their own links, you can access other user via the Admin Panel.


<br>
	    
## About
**LittleLink Custom** is a fork of [LittleLink Admin](https://github.com/latuminggi/littlelink-admin) with a **set goal** of making the admin panel **easier to use and setup**, for inexperienced and first-time user's, with the addition of **many custom features** themed around customization for the individual users, LittleLink pages.

**LittleLink Custom** was made for the purpose of making LittleLink as well as LittleLink Admin **easier to use and setup**, by people who have never coded before nor have extensive web hosting knowledge. This project is set up in a way that you can **just drag and drop** the LittleLink Custom **directory onto** your web host's **root directory** without ever having to touch the source code or deal with pesky terminal commands.

In addition to an easier setup process, this fork adds **many custom features** for an improved and more feature rich user experience. All UI pages feature a **dark mode**, which automatically applies if your operating system's or browser theme is set to dark. LittleLink Custom adds light unobtrusive **CSS animations** for an esthetically pleasing **responsive design**. Many small changes like this have been implemented that add up to a substantial feature set that **sets LittleLink Custom apart from other forks**.

## Updating

When a **new version** is released, you will get an update notification on your Admin Panel.

### Automatic one click Updater
This updater allows you to update your installation with just one click.

<br>	

**How to use the Automatic Updater:**

- To update your instance, click on the update notification on your Admin Panel.

- Click on “Update automatically” and the updater will take care of the rest.

You can still download updates manually. New versions will are still uploaded to the GitHub repository as usual.

<br>	

Before updating, the updater will create a backup. Your instance won’t save more than two backups at a time. You can download these updates from the created folder: `backups\updater-backups`.

If you switched your database to MySQL, your database will not be included in the backup.
